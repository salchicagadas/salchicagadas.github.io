			<p>Welcome to the Salchi-Cagadas website! Inspired by the Chilean Salchicagador, Sabrina Arale. Here you can find out all about Sabrina's life, get more information about Dachshunds, and of course see Sabrina LaMordina in her gallery. Originally born in Santiago de Chile, Sabrina now moves between Santiago and Punta Arenas with her Mami, Karina. She enjoys long walks, twigs, jumping in leaves, and chasing birds and mice, and is a very fashionable salchi, with an ever-growing wardrobe of dresses and coats. (Check out the gallery.)</p>
			<p>Because of her bright, bubbly personality Sabrina has lots of friends, such as fellow salchi Logan, and her housemate Annie. Unfortunately for Sabrina, as much as she loves cats, they don't seem to love her, however, everyone else she meets does üòç.</p>
			<p>Follow the tabs above to learn more about Sabrina's exciting life, or follow the social media links below to see Sabrina's personal Instagram, and other salchi profiles and fan-groups.</p>
